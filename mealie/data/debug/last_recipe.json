They grow wild during Georgia winters, but at-home cultivation kits are easy for those without forest access. I use pumpkin hot sauce, oil, and fresh herbs as a marinade, then bust out a baby grill or cast-iron skillet to get them nice and crispy.\u201d This is a multistep recipe but perfect for long winter days when you want to flood the house with toasty, irresistible aromas. When you chop the mixed herbs, save the stems and throw them into the blanching water for the vegetables to add flavor.",
