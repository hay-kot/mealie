    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Boil the potatoes: Start by first cooking the potatoes in boiling water for about 15 minutes or until fork tender. While the potatoes are cooking, you can prepare the meat mixture.",

        "Finish assembling the shepherd's pie: Spread the potatoes over the meat and smooth with a spoon. Take a fork and rough up the top a bit and garnish with a bit of parsley.",
        "Bake: Place the skillet on a baking sheet, then place it in the oven and bake for 40 minutes until golden brown on top.",
        "Garnish with more parsley and pepper and serve warm."
