# Installation
To deploy docker on your local network it is highly recommended to use docker to deploy the image straight from dockerhub. Using the docker-compose below you should be able to get a stack up and running easily by changing a few default values and deploying. Currently the only supported database is Mongo. Mealie is looking for contributors to support additional databases.

## Deployed as a Python Application
Alternatively, this project is built on Python and Mongodb. If you are dead set on deploying on a linux machine you can run this in an python environment with a dedicated MongoDatabase. Provided that you know thats how you want to host the application, I'll assume you know how to do that. I may or may not get around to writing this guide. I'm open to pull requests if anyone has a good guide on it.
