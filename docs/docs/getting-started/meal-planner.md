# Meal Planner

## Working with Meal Plans
In Mealie you can create a mealplan based off the calendar inputs on the meal planner page. There is no limit to how long or how short a meal plan is. You may also create duplicate meal plans for the same date range. After selecting your date range, click on the card for each day and seach through recipes to find your choice. After selecting a recipe for all meals save the plan. You can also randomly generate meal plans.

To edit the meal in a meal plan simply select the edit button on the card in the timeline. Similiarly, to delete a mealplan click the delete button on the card in the timeline. Currently there is no support to change the date range in a meal plan.

!!! warning
    In coming a future release recipes for meals will be restricted to specific categories.
