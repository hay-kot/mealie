# Organizing Recipes

!!! tip
    Below is a suggestion of guidelines my wife and I use for organizing our recipes within Mealie. Mealie is fairly flexible, so feel free to utilize how you'd like! 👍

In the diagram below you will see what we came up with using the new custom pages feature. The large circles indicate pages, and the rectangles indicate categories. We've grouped several 'like' categories with each other as a way to quickly find similar items.
