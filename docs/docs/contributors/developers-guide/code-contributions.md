# Contributing to Mealie

!!! Warning
    It should be known going into this that this is my first open source project, and my first public github repo I'm actively managing. If something does not make sense, or is not best practice. PLEASE feel free to reach out and let me know. I'm all about improving workflow and making it easier for contributors. 

[Please Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/R6QDyJgbD2). We are building a community of developers working on the project.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests: 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. Read the page in in [dev/dev-notes.md](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/blob/master/dev/dev-notes.md) to get an idea on where the project is at.
3. If you're interested on working on major changes please get in touch on discord and coordinate with other developers. No sense in doubling up on work if someones already on it. 
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Issue that pull request!
6. If you make changes to the dev branch reflect those changes in the dev/dev-notes.md to keep track of changes. Don't forget to add your name/handle/identifier! 

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
