# Contributing with translations

Having Mealie in different language could help the adaption of Mealie. Translations can be a great way for non-coders to contribute to Mealie.

## Is Mealie missing in your language?
If your language is missing, you can add it, by beginning to translate. We use a Vue-i18n in json files. Copy frontend/src/locales/en.json to get started.

## Improving translations
If your language is missing the translation for some strings, you can help out by adding a translation for that string. If you find a string you think could be improved, please feel free to do so. 

## Tooling
Currently we use Vue-i18n for translations. Translations are stored in json format located in [frontend/src/locales](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/tree/master/frontend/src/locales).
If you have experience with a good Translation Management System, please feel free to chime in on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/R6QDyJgbD2), as such a system could be helpful as the projects grow.
Until then, [i18n Ally for VScode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.i18n-ally) is recommended to aid in translating. It also has a nice feature, which shows translations in-place when editing code.
i18n Ally will also show which languages is missing translations.
