## v0.2.0 - Now with Test!
This is, what I think, is a big release! Tons of new features and some great quality of life improvements with some additional features. You may find that I made promises to include some fixes/features in v0.2.0. The short of is I greatly underestimated the work needed to refactor the database to a usable state and integrate categories in a way that is useful for users. This shouldn't be taken as a sign that I'm dropping those feature requests or ignoring them. I felt it was better to push a release in the current state rather than drag on development to try and fulfil all of the promises I made. 

!!! warning "Upgrade Process"
    Database Breaks! I have not yet implemented a database migration service. As such, upgrades cannot be done by simply pulling the image. You must first export your recipes, update your deployment, and then import your recipes. This pattern is likely to be how upgrades take place prior to v1.0. After v1.0 migrations will be done automatically.

### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed data validation error on missing parameters
  - Fixed failed database initialization at startup - Closes #98

    - Officially Dropped MongoDB Support
    - Database Breaks! We have not yet implemented a database migration service. As such, upgrades cannot be done by simply pulling the image. You must first export your recipes, update your deployment, and then import your recipes. This pattern is likely to be how upgrades take place prior to v1.0. After v1.0 migrations will be done automatically.

### Breaking Changes

- Internal docker port is now 80 instead of 9000. You MUST remap the internal port to connect to the UI. 

!!! error "Breaking Changes"
    As I've adopted the SQL database model I find that using 2 different types of databases will inevitably hinder development. As such after release v0.1.0 support for mongoDB will no longer be available. Prior to upgrading to v0.2.0 you will need to export your site and import after updating. This should be a painless process and require minimal intervention on the users part. Moving forward we will do our best to minimize changes that require user intervention like this and make updates a smooth process.
